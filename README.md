If this project were the foundation for a much larger application with multiple teams contributing, I would definitely adjust my approach to prioritize scalability, collaboration, and maintainability. Some key changes would be:

## Stronger project structure:
I would modularize the codebase further, clearly separating concerns (e.g., features, components, services, utilities) so that teams can work independently without stepping on each other‚Äôs toes.

## Strict coding standards:
I would enforce consistent patterns through linting, formatting (like Prettier + ESLint), and well-defined code conventions to make sure all code looks and feels consistent, regardless of who writes it.

## Scalable state management:
I would likely move to a more robust global state solution (e.g., Redux, Zustand, or React Query depending on needs), with well-isolated slices so multiple teams can manage parts of the state without tight coupling.

## Reusable component library:
Build or organize a design system (or shared UI library) so teams can reuse components rather than rebuild similar pieces differently.

## Testing and CI/CD:
I'd push for strong unit, integration, and e2e testing practices and set up automated CI pipelines to catch issues early and maintain high code quality across teams.

## Documentation-first mindset:
Good README files, API contracts, architectural decision records, and component documentation (maybe using Storybook) become critical so every team member can onboard quickly and contribute efficiently.

## Versioning and communication between teams:
If multiple teams are working on shared pieces, I‚Äôd also introduce API versioning, feature flags, and clear ownership of different modules.
